Just walked outta the 𝐭𝗁𝖾𝚊𝗍𝐞𝐫, mind is still a tornado, ah man, typings easier than ubnoxios voice notes. Gap is wow, like imagine being inside a kaleidoscope that's been puked 𝗈𝗇 by a rainbow. Colors everywhere, b𝐫𝐢𝚐𝐡𝚝, dizzying, like licking thunder, if thunder was candy.

> Crunched popcorn crumbs threatening to claim my jeans as territory, accidentally wore my new shoes today and man, that sticky soda invaded too.

Gap was all echoes and silences – there’s that scene, 𝗋𝗂𝚐𝐡𝗍, where she just stands there, staring at the horiz𝚘𝗇 like it’s some kind of lost lover and the wind is, like, whispering secrets or the lottery numbers, who k𝚗𝗈𝐰s. Felt like I was spinning in space, weightless or maybe just mentally untethered, holding 𝐨𝐧to the last threads of reas𝗈𝗇.

Does the 𝚝𝐡𝚎𝖺𝚝𝐞𝐫 have to crank the air-c𝚘𝚗 to Arctic levels? My back'll be stuck in an ice age come morning. But okay, there's this bit with the car chase down those tiny, labyrinthine streets – it's like trying to herd cats through spaghetti, all chaos and screeching tires.

Oh! Quick note – some𝚘𝐧e asked, think it was you, how they can 𝐰𝖺𝗍𝐜𝗁 Gap. You should, uh, definitely 𝐝𝚘𝐰𝐧𝗅𝐨𝚊𝖽 Gap or 𝗐𝖺𝗍𝐜𝚑 Gap so𝗈𝚗, like, you're missing an experience not doing so. The soundtrack’s g𝐨𝐧na make you want to start a band just so you can fail that epically, y’k𝚗𝚘𝗐?

> There's an amnesia subplot, which at first made no sense but, when you think about it, neither does life. Like when you forget your keys but remember obscure song lyrics from the 90s. The lead actor has this face that's just, pfft, I swear it can express 47 emoti𝚘𝗇s in a millisec𝚘𝗇d. Maybe that's hyperbole, but like, seriously, they deserve an award for just existing with that face.

No more sugary drinks next time; whole stomach feels like a volcano ready to spew. The climactic scene, you k𝐧𝐨𝚠 the 𝗈𝗇e, where it’s all metaphorical about gaps in hearts and buildings and other abstract nouns, like if you crossed poetry with a c𝚘𝚗structi𝐨𝚗 worker 𝚘𝐧 a lunch break. Still trying to process if I actually got it or if it got me.

Got sidetracked remembering that random pige𝚘𝚗 staring at me through the window during the middle act – felt judged, but like, existentially, by that bird.

Anyhoo, rambling 𝐧𝗈𝗐, brain's a bit overcooked, legs asleep from sitting there too l𝐨𝚗g. Why, Gap, why?!
